Created a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function takes the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
The user is prompted to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. The program prints the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, the original price is printed.
